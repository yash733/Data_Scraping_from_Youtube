Coding is the most in-demand and upcoming skill of the industry and it will continue to grow as the years pass. Despite all this, students often restrict themselves from getting started with coding, and not only students, but the parents are also not very much active in encouraging their wards to learn to code.  

And we believe now is the time to break this stigma around this conversation and to promote coding culture among students and create genuine interest & curiosity in them to get started with coding. Keeping this in mind, GeeksforGeeks is coming up with an exciting coding tournament exclusively for school students!

798,16. Nth highest salary (Top 50 SQL Interview Questions) | GeeksforGeeks,"67,950 views","Oct 9, 2019",958,"Find Complete Code at GeeksforGeeks Article: 

This video is contributed byselect min(sal)  from(select distinct sal from emp order by sal desc)
where rownum<=3;
without minus we can use it in this waySimple way to find Nth highest salary:

select min(salary) from   
(select distinct salary from employee order by salary desc)   
where rownum <= N;this is a great content, have been looking such a content  for daysWe can use this   ""Select * from emp( Select rownum r, distinct(sal) from emp order by desc) where r = 3;""rownum is not available in other db. these sql are Oracle specificwith salary_Details as (
select emp_name, emp_sal, dense_rank () over ( order by emp_sal desc) as rank from employee)
select * from salary_Details
where rank = 3;SELECT DISTINCT Salary as EighthDistinctHighestSalary
FROM Employee
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 7;
by changing the offer we can obtain the nth numberI would wrap it into another sub-query and assign rownum alias... then in outer query you could just check for equalsAwesome explained sirMan u gave such a general startegy  so awesome
For mysql users
U can use TOP clause in place of rownumJust replace n with the value you want

WITH CTE AS
(SELECT 
    *,
    nth_value(sal, n) OVER(ORDER BY sal DESC) as nvalue
FROM emp)


SELECT * (OR DISTINCT * to remove the duplicates)
FROM CTE
WHERE nvalue IS NOT null;select distinct sal emp where rownum = n order by sal desc;

n=1,2,3,4.....Greate sir, it can be done by using = operator instead of minus operator.Are these questions are good enough for 2 years of experiance employee in sqlThe easiest way is using offset and fetch , let me give u an example , if we have to fetch 4th higest salery , we will use query like this : ""   select distinct salery from Employee order by salery desc offset 3 row fetch next 1 row only "".  offset is for skip and fetch is for limit , i hope u understand . if u want me to explain more reply to the comment. thank uExplained well It's very helpfulJust order by desc and use LIMIT 1 and OFFSET N?getting error minus identifier is not valid at this position in the query,

SELECT * FROM(SELECT DISTINCT MARKS FROM tbl_studentData order by MARKS desc )
where rownum <=3

minus 

SELECT * FROM(SELECT DISTINCT MARKS FROM tbl_studentData order by MARKS desc )

This video is contributed byFirst, The tables will be joined ( as per cross join) giving 28 rows. Then the where filter is applied on the 28 rows data set ( sequence of execution). Since dept tables does not have dept id = 50 , it will return an empty result set.Output: 0 rows
m = 7 rows
n = 0 rows (for d.deptno=50)
So output should be 7*0 which is 0After applying condition it will not be a full join it will become inner join as written in GeeksforGeeks SQL tutorialThank you so muchI thaught I didn't understand cross join but seems I have been using it without knowing.

Is cross join the same as doing this?

```
select
  *
from
  emp, dept
```please explain the diff between full join and cross joinis it pronounced number or namba ?output is 0 row selectedno rows will returnwhy we are writing like that d.deptno?Output : 0 rows fetchedoutput: 0 rowsIt will be filled null value in all associated employee tuplesWhat's the output?I think no rows will return.
